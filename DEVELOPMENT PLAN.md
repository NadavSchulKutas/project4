### Things to Add:
* Game randomly chooses which powerup to spawn instead of always spawning ReverseLaser
* I don't think having the Shield powerup does anything
* I still want to figure out mouse controls, although that's something I'd have to handle on my own

### Code "Features":
* No cap on acceleration (ignore for now)
* ~~Because photon velocity is inherited, players moving fast enough can create photons that wrap around the screen and shoot them in the back~~ OUTDATED. Photons no longer inherit player velocity
