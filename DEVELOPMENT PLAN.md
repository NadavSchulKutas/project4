### Finalized Ideas:
* Two players each control a ship and fight each other. 
* Destroying the opponent scores you one point.
* The game is over once one player reaches a certain number of points (easy to adjust)

### Proposed Ideas:
* 11 points to win
* Winning a point ends the "round", putting both players in their starting position
* Maybe include some obstacles in the environment that block players/their shots.
  * If included, we could have a pool of level layouts with a random wone being chosen every round.
* Power-ups randomly spawn. Aquired power-ups are kept between rounds.
  * Long-range shots
  * Bouncing shots
  * Allow player to ram into opponent for kills
* Map border beings to shrink if a match has gone on for too long.
  * Alternatively (or additionally), power-ups always spawning near the middle should encourage aggression.
